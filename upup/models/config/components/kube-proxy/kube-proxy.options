KubeProxy:
  LogLevel: 2
  # 20m might cause kube-proxy CPU starvation on full nodes, resulting in
  # delayed service updates. But, giving it more would be a breaking change
  # to the overhead requirements for existing clusters.
  # Any change here should be accompanied by a proportional change in CPU
  # requests of other per-node add-ons (e.g. fluentd).
  CPURequest: 20m
