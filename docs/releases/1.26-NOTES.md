## Release notes for kOps 1.26 series

**&#9888; kOps 1.26 has not been released yet! &#9888;**

This is a document to gather the release notes prior to the release.

# Significant changes

* The default networking provider for new clusters is now Cilium.

## AWS only

* Bastions are now fronted by a Network Load Balancer.

* Instance group images can now be dynamically fetched through an AWS SSM Parameter.

* The AWS Load Balancer, when enabled, will run on worker nodes if IRSA is enabled as of Kubernetes version 1.24.

* As of Kubernetes version 1.26 and with IRSA enabled, control plane nodes will now run with a max hop limit of 1 for the metadata service. This will prevent Pods without host networking from accessing the instance metadata service.

* New IPv6 clusters now default to using private topology.

* CapacityRebalance can be enabled/disabled on ASGs through a new `capacityRebalance` field in InstanceGroup specs.

# Breaking changes

## Other breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.20 has been removed.

* The "external" networking option is not supported for Kubernetes 1.26 or later. For "bring your own"
CNIs, use the "cni" networking option instead.

# Deprecations

* The "kops get [CLUSTER]" command is deprecated. It is replaced by "kops get all [CLUSTER]".

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.21 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.27.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.22 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.28.

* Support for Ubuntu 18.04 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.28.

* Support for AWS Classic Load Balancer for API is deprecated and should not be used for newly created clusters.

* All legacy addons are deprecated in favor of managed addons, including the [metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) and the [autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler).

* Due to lack of maintainers, the CloudFormation support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this target.
