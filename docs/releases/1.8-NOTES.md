_This is a WIP document describing changes to the upcoming kops 1.8 release_

# Significant changes

* flannel now has a `backend` property in the manifest, which can be either `udp` or `vxlan`.  `udp`
is not recommended, but will be the default value for existing clusters or clusters created via manifests.
`kops create cluster` with `--networking flannel` will use `vxlan`, `--networking flannel-vxlan`
or `--networking flannel-udp` can be specified to explicitly choose a backend mode.

# Full changelist

* ExperimentalCriticalPodAnnotation feature gate is now enabled by default in kubelet [@andreychernih](https://github.com/andreychernih) [#3345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/3345)
