_This is a WIP document describing changes to the upcoming kops 1.7 release_

# Significant changes

* Default disk size increased to 64GB (masters) and 128GB (nodes).  This does have a higher cost, but also gives us more inodes & more iops (and more disk space, of course!)
* Calico now configured with the correct pod CIDR: #2768. Please refer to the *Required Actions* section for details regarding this.

# Required Actions

* Existing Calico users on clusters that were created prior to kops 1.7 are suspectible to IP conflict between Pods and Services due to an overlap of the two IP ranges. Migration to a new Pod CIDR is recommended, and is a manual procedure due to risk of potential downtime during this operation. For the migration procedure, please refer to [this document](../upgrade_from_kops_1.6_to_1.7_calico_cidr_migration.md).
