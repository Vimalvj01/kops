## Release notes for kOps 1.22 series

**&#9888; kOps 1.22 has not been released yet! &#9888;**

This is a document to gather the release notes prior to the release.

# Significant changes

## Instance metadata service version 2

 On AWS, kOps will enable [Instance Metadata Service Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html) by default with a max-hop-limit of 1 on new clusters that use Kubernetes 1.22. This means that any container running in the cluster will be unable to connect to the instance metadata _unless_ the container is running with `hostNetworking: true`. This will increase security by default, but may break some types of workloads. In order to revert to old behavior, add the following to the InstanceGroup:

```
spec:
  instanceMetadata:
    httpTokens: optional
```

This change only affects dedicated API server nodes and worker nodes. It does not affect control plane nodes.

## Other significant changes

* New clusters running Kubernetes 1.22 will have AWS EBS CSI driver enabled by default.

# Breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.

* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.

# Required actions

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.18 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.24.

* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.

* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.

* The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels are deprecated and might be removed from control plane nodes in kOps 1.23.

* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.

# Other changes of note

* It is no longer necessary to set `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1` in the environment when using AWS assumed roles with the `kops` CLI.
