**&#9888; kOps 1.22 has not been released yet! &#9888;**

This is a document to gather the release notes prior to the release.

# Significant changes

# Breaking changes

* Support for Kubernetes versions 1.15 and 1.16 has been removed.

* The legacy location for downloads `s3://https://kubeupv2.s3.amazonaws.com/kops/` has been deprecated and will not be used for new releases. The new canonical downloads location is `https://artifacts.k8s.io/binaries/kops/`.

* [TODO] The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` and `kubernetes.io/role` labels [will be] removed from control plane nodes.

# Required Actions

# Deprecations

* Support for Kubernetes version 1.17 is deprecated and will be removed in kOps 1.23.

* The [manifest based metrics server addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/metrics-server) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.

* The [manifest based cluster autoscaler addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/tree/master/addons/cluster-autoscaler) has been deprecated in favour of a configurable addon.

* Due to lack of maintainers, the Aliyun/Alibaba Cloud support has been deprecated. The current implementation will be left as-is until the implementation needs updates or otherwise becomes incompatible. At that point, it will be removed. We very much welcome anyone willing to contribute to this cloud provider.
